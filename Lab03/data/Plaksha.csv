"Wastewater, Resource efficiency","Wastewater treatment,Membrane technologies,Resource recovery,Translating technology solutions for MSMEs,Circular economy","Dr Malini Balakrishnan is the Director-Center for Water Security. Prior to joining Plaksha, she was a Senior Fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi where she spent over 25 years being closely involved with different industry sectors, targeting resource use/recovery and waste utilization. The work on enhancing resource efficiency in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (covering multiple sectors such as metal fabrication/finishing, chemicals and intermediates manufacture etc.) in India and select south Asian countries achieved significant savings in energy, water and raw materials. Her research efforts have been primarily targeted at evolving affordable solutions to specific local problems. Dr Balakrishnan has experience in execution and coordination of pilot demonstrations of technologies such as membrane filtration (for upgrading the juice clarification process in the Indian sugar industry), diffusion dialysis, acid retardation and nanofiltration based recovery systems (for waste acid/rinse water in Indian metal finishing SMEs). She initiated and led TERIs efforts in field testing of membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for wastewater treatment using indigenously prepared membranes from industrial waste. These demonstrations have provided a deeper understanding of challenges in technology adaptation and possible approaches that would encourage the uptake of such technologies. 

Dr. Balakrishnan has worked extensively in partnership with various international and national research groups, leading many multi-institutional international projects. Several of these projects were funded by the European Commission with TERI as the lead partner. She has successfully integrated applied R&D with academic research. As an adjunct faculty at the TERI School of Advanced Studies, Dr. Balakrishnan has supervised PhD candidates and published over 100 research papers. She has served as a nominated expert in select programmes of the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, in the Chemical Division Council of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), reviewer for various funding agencies and peer-reviewed international journals.

Dr Balakrishnan has a B.E. (Hons) in Chemical Engineering and M.Sc. (Hons) in Chemistry, both from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India, M.A.Sc in Chemical Engineering from University of Waterloo, Canada, and PhD in Biochemical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, India.

Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence,Search methods for problem solving,Knowledge representation,Memory based reasoning,Constraint satisfaction problems,Game playing,Epistemic logic","Prior to joining Plaksha, Dr. Deepak Khemani was a faculty member at IIT Madras, where he worked on artificial intelligence with a focus on symbolic reasoning. His research has been on approaches in which an autonomous agent can represent the world around it, draw upon experience to solve problems, and can imagine the future to search for solutions for problems. He has done several projects for government and industry, and collaborative projects funded by BMBF Germany and UKIERI.

He started working in AI during his doctoral studies where he explored the application of memory-based planning in the game of contract bridge. Contract bridge is a game yet unconquered by AI, unlike other games like Chess, Go, Backgammon, and Scrabble where machines rule supreme. His current goals are to combine knowledge representation, heuristic search, and constraints processing to build problem solvers. These methods can be applied to creating articulate tutoring systems that can help students with math and physics problems, amongst other things.

Dr. Khemani teaches courses at the heart of AI, and has popular courses on Search Methods, Knowledge Representation, and Constraint Satisfaction on the NPTEL/Swayam platform. His 2013 book A First Course in AI has wide ranging coverage of the subject.

He has also had interest in popular science and was in the small team that started the children’s science magazine Jantar Mantar in the early nineties published by Tamil Nadu Science Forum. During that period he also wrote a small book The Signs of Zodiac explaining astronomy to young children.

Educational Technology Computer Science Education,"Tinkering and Making in engineering design education, Active learning pedagogies in computer science education, Emerging technologies for scaffolding the learning process","Dr. Ashutosh Raina obtained his PhD in Educational Technology at IIT Bombay. His thesis focused on tinkering as a means of problem-solving in engineering design. He designed a learning environment to nurture tinkering while solving problems from educational robotics using Lego Mindstorms.
He studied learner’s actions and their interactions with the learning environment and found tinkering to be supportive of personalized problem-solving where the learners were seen performing quick and focused cycles of playful exploration, experimentation and feedback, gradually evolving their solution ideas or strategies. He also found that the learners had developed a sense of agency and confidence in their problem-solving approaches.  

Dr. Raina has worked and consulted on pedagogical and activity design for various curriculums, such as AI for Atal Tinker labs and the Computer Masti Curriculum. Also, he is an instructor for the demystifying networking course on Swayam and NPTEL. He has instructed several faculty development programs in various government and private institutions.
